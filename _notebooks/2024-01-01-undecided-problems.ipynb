    "Modern systems and browsers address the halting problem, where a program takes too long to load, through various mechanisms to prevent unresponsiveness. Some common strategies include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Timeouts: Systems set a maximum time limit (timeout) for a program to load. If the program exceeds this limit, it is terminated to avoid causing unresponsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asynchronous Loading: Browsers use asynchronous loading to allow certain tasks to run independently of the main program. This prevents a single slow task from blocking the entire execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web Workers: In web development, web workers enable parallel processing, allowing time-consuming tasks to be executed in the background without affecting the main program's responsiveness."
