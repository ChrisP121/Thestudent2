```python
#!pip install emoji
from emoji import emojize
print(emojize(":thumbs_up: Python is awesome! :grinning_face:"))
```


    👍 Python is awesome! 😀


- We added new hacks to our website such as emoji's, the Standardized test data, and a grade calculator.
- We inserted these games as a “.md”.
- We also added python tricks to insert emojis and exploring data with newspaper and wiki libraries.
- Had trouble with running make and not having correct command lines.
- We resolved this problem by defining the problem key word which we hadnt done before.
